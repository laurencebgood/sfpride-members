                    <p>In order to accomplish the election of directors during this time when we cannot meet in person, it appears necessary to separate the election of directors from the rest of the AGM proceedings. Voting by secret ballot, which is critical to the board elections, is not feasible in an online meeting. </p>
                </div>
            </div>

                    <ul>
                        <li>The date of record to vote in this election was <b>July 15, 2020</b>, 60 days prior to the Annual General Meeting (<b>Sept. 12, 2020</b>). </li>
                        <li>Through Aug. 14, SF Pride staff will solicit mailing address updates from the existing membership.</li>
                        <li>Staff will develop written ballots as of Aug. 19, and prepare a physical mailing to send out. </li>
                        <li>Friday, Aug. 21 is 20 days prior to the AGM. As per the election procedures, a written notice will be sent, via the postal service, to the membership. In addition, an abbreviated version of the notice will be sent via email. </li>
                        <li>On Aug. 21, the notice is mailed, alongside written ballots. This mailing specifies:
                            <ul>
                                <li>The date by which ballots must be returned.</li>
                                <li>The number of total ballots that will need to be returned (quorum as of date of ballot printing).</li>
                                <li>A ballot of all nominated candidates.</li>
                                <li>A black envelope to seal the ballot in (hence ensuring vote by secret ballot), replicating as closely as possible the standing procedure for voting at an in-person AGM.</li>
                                <li>Self-addressed and stamped return envelope, which the member would use to identify oneself for voting eligibility.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>In essence, this creates a voting period of Aug. 21-Sept. 18 (see below). </li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <div class="col-12 col-lg-6">
                    <ul>
                        <li>Members can post-mark their ballot until six days after the AGM (i.e., <b>Sept 18, 2020</b>). </li>
                        <li>In-person voting or drop-off opportunities will be available twice per week during the voting period (as a courtesy). These opportunities are TBD, and may include drop-in hours at the Pride offices or tabling hours at a public outdoor venue. </li>
                        <li>The AGM, held online on Saturday, Sept. 12, will be used for candidate statements, Q&A, and any other business that still stands. Any actions so noticed on the 20-day notice, or any proper motion brought at the meeting. </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Furthermore, most of the processes laid out in Policy A.11, <b><em>Procedures for Nominating and Electing Directors</em></b>, will be followed, such as: </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The appointment of Election Inspectors (will take place at the August Membership Meeting)</li>
                        <li>The appointment of Election Observers (will take place at the August Membership Meeting)</li>
                        <li>The process by which votes are validated and counted.</li>
                        <li>The vote validation and counting process will take place on Wednesday, Sept. 23, which allows time for any ballots postmarked on Sept. 18 to arrive to the Pride offices.</li>
                        <li>The vote validation and counting will take place in as safe a manner as possible, with masks and physical distance.</li>
