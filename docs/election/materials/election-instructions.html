                    <h2>A Guide to the Voting Process</h2>
                    <p>Eligible voters will receive a packet by mail via the <abbr title="United States Postal Service">USPS</abbr>, which contains all the physical materials they need to participate in the <strong>2020 San Francisco LGBT Pride Parade and Celebration Committee Board of Directors Election</strong>.</p>
                    <p>Members shall cast their votes by indicating their choices in the box to the right of the candidate's names on the paper ballot, and may vote for as few or as many candidates of their choosing to fill the possible <strong>seven (7)</strong> open seats on the Board of Directors.</p>
                    <p>Those candidates receiving the highest <strong>simple majority</strong> votes <strong>(50% + 1 of votes cast)</strong> will fill an open seat in the order according the numbers of votes attained. In the event of a tie that would determine the election or non-election of any nominee, a secondary election by mail-in-ballot will be held for those candidates only.</p>
                    <p>A number of ballots equal to or greater than a quorum of the membership (one third) at the time of the election (August 20th) must be cast for the election to be valid and representative of the membership. The exact number of ballots required is noted on the ballot.</p>
                    <p>A ballot on which a voter's choice is unintelligible to the election officials and/or the election inspectors will be disqualified.</p>
                    <p>To facilitate both secret balloting and verification of voter eligibility, members shall use both of the envelopes provided in their election materials packet.</p>
                    <p>A voting member must:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>place their completed ballot inside the <strong class="text-uppercase">black</strong> envelope provided, seal it, making no identifying marks to the outside of the envelope.</li>
                        <li>place the sealed black envelope, containing the completed ballot, inside the <strong class="text-uppercase">manilla return envelope</strong>, and seal that as well.</li>
                        <li>place the manilla envelope (which contains the black envelope, which in turn contains the ballot) into the mail, ensuring postmark no later than September 18th, or return the ballot in person to any of the drop off locations during scheduled operating hours.</li>
