title: Holding a Board Election during Shelter in Place
---

The Board is resolving to separate the board elections from the Annual General Meeting on September 12, 2020. Because we canâ€™t meet in person, due to the ongoing pandemic, and because the secret ballot process is important to the election, we believe it is best to conduct the elections by mail, according to the process that the staff has developed.
